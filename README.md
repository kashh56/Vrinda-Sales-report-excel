Project Overview
----------------

*   **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring that the raw data is accurate, consistent, and free of errors by checking for missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
*   **Data Pre-processing**: Transforming the data to make it ready for analysis by handling missing values, normalizing data, and adjusting formats where needed.
*   **Pivot Tables**: Using pivot tables to summarize large datasets, allowing for better understanding and easier extraction of meaningful insights.
*   **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or variables that can enhance the analysis, making the data more useful and insightful for further decision-making.
*   **Final Dashboard**: Building a user-friendly dashboard to visualize the results, helping to present key findings and insights effectively.
